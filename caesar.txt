To be or not to be that is the question
tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune
or suffer the pain of envy

may the force be with you always
live long and prosper
do or do not
there is no try
i got a bad feeling about this
to be or not to be      
that is the question
never leave home without it
theres an app for that
just do it
that's what she said

Luke, I am your father.

I am locutus of borg.
